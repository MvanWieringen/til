# Autumn Effect

An effect, generating a soft glow, that works pretty well on autumn pictures, especially in woodlands.

1. Duplicate layer (<kbd>CTRL</kdb> + <kdb>J</kbd>)
2. On duplicated layer, open `Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur`
3. Apply a radius around 20-30 pixels, just so we can still recognize the structure
4. Open `Image > Adjustments > Levels` (<kbd>CTRL</kdb> + <kdb>L</kbd>)
5. Lift highlights by dragging far right cursor to the left until the hightlights start blowing up
6. Bring down shadows by dragging far left cursor to the right until shadow area are black enough
7. Bring opacity of the layer to 0%
8. Reintroduce the opacity up to desired effect
